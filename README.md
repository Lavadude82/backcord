# Backcord -
A backend for an app similar to discord. It has not finished development. I don't have plans of   releasing soon, but I do plan to keep working on this project. 

# Why? Who Are You?
I'm just a guy who likes to code. Thanks to having a great friend, [*catflare*](https://github.com/nekoflare). They've helped me quite a bit. I've never used typescript before... You should check out their projects! Their project, [*Serchat*](https://github.com/Serval-Chat), inspired me to learn, and I am thankful for their help.

# What It Does
This repository just creates a simple backend with API routes for **Users, and Tokens** (as of this moment). I will try to implement more in the future.

# Requirements
 - Functional Mongo DB Database
 - Node Version 24 (Some Modules Require It Apprently)
 - A Will to Mess Around
 
 **Note** - Instructions May Not Always Work (Random Pushes Before Instruction Updates May Occur).

# Run Instructions (ts-node)
To run this with *ts-node*, simply clone the repository, install requirements using npm, and use the start script. Here's a one-liner:  
`git clone https://github.com/Lavadude82/backcord && cd backcord && npm i && npm start`

You can run it later by just using `npm start` in the same directory.

# Run Instructions (node)
To run this with *node*, simply clone the repository, install requirements using npm, and use the build script, then run the index.js in the **dist/** directory. Here's a one-liner:  
`git clone https://github.com/Lavadude82/backcord && cd backcord && npm i && npm run build && npm run js-ver`

You can run it later by just using `npm run js-ver` in the same directory.
